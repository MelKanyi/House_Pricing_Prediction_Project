Predict sale prices: Python Project IP Week 9 Core



#### By **Kanyi Melissa**

## Description

* You just got some contract with a real estate company, i.e; Hass Consulting Company,to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out!
* Create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

## Experimental Design


* Find and deal with outliers anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
* Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
* Performing regression analysis.
* Incorporate categorical independent variables into your models.
* Check for multicollinearity
* Provide a recommendation based on your analysis.
* Create residual plots for your models, and assess heteroskedasticity using Barlett's test.
